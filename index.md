Hey, Welcome to my homepage! I am a third year undergraduate student in Mathematics and Statistics department at IIT Kanpur. My advisor is <a href='https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/vinaypn/'>Vinay P. Namboodiri</a>. My research interests include Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. 

I have worked on the problem of Visual Question Generation in which we generated natural questions using differential multimodal embeddings and experimented with different ways of obtaining the multimodal embeddings. I am also interested in the problem of finding better methods of evaluation in NLP and obtaining proper sentence embeddings.
